I'm preparing this project for production and I need your help making the following improvements efficiently and correctly:

🔐 1. Payment Methods
Implement each and every payment method in full, such as M-PESA and Visa/MasterCard.

Use placeholder values only for the parts that I must personally provide (e.g. M-PESA API keys, URLs, and credentials).

Ensure all endpoints are secure, and user feedback (success/failure) is handled cleanly in the UI.

🔁 2. Forgot Password Flow
Implement a robust and working "Forgot Password" flow that:

Sends a reset link or code.

Allows the user to securely set a new password.

Handles all possible errors (invalid email, expired token, etc.) gracefully with proper UI feedback.

🛠️ 3. Fix These Errors:
✅ Supabase-related 400 errors from this URL:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://ukeknrexersgeghbmtar.supabase.co/rest/v1/user_bots?select=*,bot:bot_id(*)&user_id=eq.ea373166-b448-4109-a2ab-27e0951c4092
Make sure query structure, user ID, and auth are correct.

✅ Backend analytics API errors (connection refused):

GET /analytics/dashboard

GET /analytics/performance
Fix the requests or ensure that the server at localhost:5000/api/analytics/... is running and accessible. Add fallback/error handling logic in case the API is offline.

✅ Frontend crash from missing function:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Uncaught TypeError: refreshUserProfile is not a function (at AdminRoute.tsx:17:7)
Check if the refreshUserProfile() function is imported and defined.

If missing, either implement or remove its reference safely.

✅ Improve error handling throughout the app:

Add error boundaries for React components.

Display user-friendly error messages where needed.

🧹 4. Final Touches
Clean up unused code and packages.

Ensure all .env variables are being used securely.

Optimize imports, remove logs, and ensure the app runs without console errors or warnings.

Assume that the base tech stack is Vite + React + TypeScript + Supabase + Node/Express backend.

Keep everything production-ready, modular, and easy for me to configure the sensitive parts later.
