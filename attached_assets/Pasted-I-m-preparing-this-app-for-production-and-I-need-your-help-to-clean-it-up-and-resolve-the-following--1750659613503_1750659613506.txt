I'm preparing this app for production and I need your help to clean it up and resolve the following issues:

404 Errors and Broken Routes:

The /dashboard/users and /marketplace routes are returning 404.

Please ensure these pages/components exist, are correctly routed in App.tsx, and are not mistakenly caught by the NotFound route.

If they don’t exist yet, scaffold basic placeholders for both.

Analytics API Errors:

I’m seeing ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED for:

GET http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/dashboard

GET http://localhost:5000/api/analytics/performance

Please:

Check that the backend server is expected to run on port 5000. If not, adjust the base URL.

Ensure axios is using environment variables (e.g. VITE_API_BASE_URL) and not hardcoded URLs.

Gracefully handle network error cases and show a fallback/loading UI.

Component Import Errors:

I’m getting this error:
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/payments/PaymentModal.tsx' does not provide an export named 'PaymentModal'

Ensure PaymentModal.tsx actually exports the component as:
export const PaymentModal = () => { ... }
or
export default PaymentModal and import it accordingly.

App.tsx Error – NotFound is not defined:

This happens when using <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />

Either:

Import NotFound properly from the correct path, or

Create a basic NotFound.tsx component under components/ if it doesn’t exist.

AdminRoute.tsx Error – refreshUserProfile failing:

Error: ReferenceError: api is not defined

Ensure api is imported where refreshUserProfile() is defined.
Example: import api from '@/lib/api' (or correct path).

Also, verify that the api.ts file exports the required methods.

Ensure marketplace is working:

Create and register a working Marketplace.tsx component under /src/pages/Marketplace.tsx if not present.

Route it under a valid <Route path="/marketplace" element={<Marketplace />} />.

Final Cleanup:

Make sure no pages render blank or crash.

Add error boundaries if necessary to catch React rendering issues.

Ensure all required components are correctly imported/exported and used.
